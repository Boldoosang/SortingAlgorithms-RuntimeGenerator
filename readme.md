# Sorting Algorithms Runtime Generator
Welcome to our Analysis of Sorting Algorithms project! This project was designed to generate the runtime data for different sorts, which would then be used to evaluate different sorting algorithms based on their efficiency in various cases. The findings have already been analyzed and the report/raw data has been included as deliverables in the deliverables section below. If you wish to perform your own analysis on the various sorts, this repository is a good starting point.

Completed on 29th November 2020, and updated on GitHub on 12th October 2023 to be archived.


## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
* Ensure that [DevC++](http://orwelldevcpp.blogspot.com/) is installed. 
Alternative compilers can be used, but the .dev file was produced in DevC++ and can be opened directly.
* Open the .dev file in DevC++.
* Customize the sorting parameters within the main function for each type of dataset growth.
* Compile and run.


## FEATURES
The following is a list of sorts that are implemented for analysis:
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort (multiple)
* Quick Sort (multiple)
* Heap Sort
* Radix Sort
